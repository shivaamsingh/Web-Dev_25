    SEO= Search Engine Optimization 
    SEO is the process of optimizing a website to improve its visibility and ranking on search engines like Google, Bing, etc. It involves various techniques such as keyword research, content optimization, link building, and technical SEO to attract organic traffic and enhance the user experience.


    
    CLS= Cumulative Layout Shift
    CLS is a metric that measures the visual stability of a webpage as it loads. It quantifies how much the content shifts around during loading, which can negatively impact user experience. A low CLS score indicates a stable page layout, while a high score suggests significant layout shifts that can frustrate users.


    
    LCP= Largest Contentful Paint
    LCP is a performance metric that measures the time it takes for the largest visible content element on a webpage to load and become visible to the user. It is an important factor in user experience, as a fast LCP indicates that the main content of the page is loading quickly, enhancing user satisfaction.(2.5 seconds is the ideal LCP time)


    FID= First Input Delay
    FID is a performance metric that measures the time it takes for a webpage to respond to the first user interaction, such as clicking a button or link. A low FID indicates a responsive page that quickly reacts to user input, while a high FID suggests delays that can lead to frustration and a poor user experience.
    (100 milliseconds is the ideal FID time)
